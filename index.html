        <header>What is R Programming?</header>
        <p>R is a programming language and also a software environment for statistical computing and data analysis. R
          was
          developed by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the university of Auckland, New Zealand. R is an open-source
          programming language and it is available on widely used platforms e.g. Windows, Linux, and Mac. It generally
          comes with a command-line interface and provides a vast list of packages for performing tasks. R is an
          interpreted language that supports both procedural programming and object-oriented programming.</p>

        <header>R and Rust</header>
        <p>R and Rust serve different purposes in the programming world. R is a language designed for statistical
          computing and graphics, widely used among statisticians and data analysts. Rust, on the other hand, is a
          systems
          programming language that aims to provide memory safety, concurrency, and performance.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Hello_World">
        <header>Hello World</header>
        <p>R is the most popular language used for Statistical Computing and Data Analysis with the support of over 10,
          000+ free packages in CRAN repository. Like any other programming language, R has a specific syntax which is
          important to understand if you want to make use of its powerful features. This article assumes R is already
          installed on your machine. We will be using RStudio but we can also use R command prompt by typing the
          following
          command in the command line.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>$ R</li>
          <p>This will launch the interpreter and now let’s write a basic Hello World program to get started.
          <p>

          <code>
# R program to illustrate <br>
# printing output of an R program <br>
# print string<br>
print("GFG")<br>
# print variable<br>
# it will print 'GeeksforGeeks' on the console<br>
x - "GeeksforGeeks"<br>
print(x) <br></code>
          <p>We can see that “Hello, World!” is being printed on the console. Now we can do the same thing using print()
            which prints to the console. Usually, we will write our code inside scripts which are called RScripts in R.
            To
            create one, write the below given code in a file and save it as myFile.R and then run it in console by
            writing:</p>
          <li>Rscript myFile.R</li>

        <header>Variables</header>
        <p>A variable is a memory allocated for the storage of specific data and the name associated with the variable
          is
          used to work around this reserved block. The name given to a variable is known as its variable name. Usually a
          single variable stores only the data belonging to a certain data type. The name is so given to them because
          when
          the program executes there is subject to change hence it varies from time to time.</p>
        <code># R program to illustrate<nr>
# Initialization of variables<br>

# using equal to operator<br>
var1 = "hello"<br>
print(var1)<br>

# using leftward operator<br>
var2 <- "hello"<br>
print(var2)<br>

# using rightward operator<br>
"hello" -> var3<br>
print(var3)<br>

        <p>R Programming Language is a dynamically typed language, i.e. the R Language Variables are not declared with a
          data type rather they take the data type of the R-object assigned to them. This feature is also shown in
          languages like Python and PHP</p>

          Taking Input from User in R Programming
        </header>
        <p>In R language readline() method takes input in string format. If one inputs an integer then it is inputted as
          a
          string, lets say, one wants to input 255, then it will input as “255”, like a string. So one needs to convert
          that inputted value to the format that he needs. In this case, string “255” is converted to integer 255. To
          convert the inputted value to the desired data type, there are some functions in R, </p>

        <p>Control statements are expressions used to control the execution and flow of the program based on the
          conditions provided in the statements. These structures are used to make a decision after assessing the
          variable. In this article, we’ll discuss all the control statements with the examples.</p>

          Functions in R Programming
        </header>
        <p>Functions are useful when you want to perform a certain task multiple times. A function accepts input
          arguments
          and produces the output by executing valid R commands that are inside the function. In R Programming Language
          when you are creating a function the function name and the file in which you are creating the function need
          not
          be the same and you can have one or more functions in R.</p>
